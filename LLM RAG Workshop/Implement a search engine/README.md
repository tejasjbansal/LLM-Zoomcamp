# Knowledge-Vault

## Project Description
This project is a basic search engine that utilizes both Text Search Method and Vector/Embedding Method to handle user queries and search within documents. It demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to combining traditional text search techniques with modern vector-based methods to improve search accuracy and relevance.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Version 3.10
- **Optional**: A GitHub account for version control and project management

## Preparing the Environment
To set up the environment and start using the search engine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Packages**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   After installing the required packages, start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**
   In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `knowledge-vault.ipynb` notebook to start using the search engine.

## Usage
The `knowledge-vault.ipynb` notebook contains all the necessary code and instructions to utilize the search engine. Follow the steps in the notebook to:

- Load and preprocess your documents
- Implement both Text Search and Vector/Embedding Search methods
- Execute search queries and retrieve results

## Features
- **Text Search Method**: Utilizes traditional text matching techniques to find documents containing the query terms.
- **Vector/Embedding Method**: Employs advanced vector representations to find semantically similar documents, even if they do not contain the exact query terms.
