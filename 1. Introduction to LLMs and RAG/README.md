## 1. Introduction to LLMs and Rag

### What is an LLM?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the data it has been trained on.

### How Does an LLM Work?
Training: It is trained on a vast amount of text data from books, websites, and other sources.
Learning Patterns: During training, it learns the patterns, structure, and meaning of language.
Generating Text: When given a prompt or question, it can generate relevant and coherent responses based on what it has learned.

### Applications:
Customer Support: Automating responses to common queries.
Content Creation: Assisting in writing articles, blogs, and reports.
Education: Helping with homework, explanations, and tutoring.
Translation: Converting text from one language to another.

### RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Rag is a technique used in large language models (LLMs) to improve their performance. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Retrieval**: The model first searches for relevant information from a large collection of documents or a database. This step helps the model find accurate and specific data related to the question or topic.

2. **Augmented Generation**: After retrieving the relevant information, the model uses this data to generate a response. This helps the model produce more accurate, informed, and contextually relevant answers.

In short, RAG combines searching for information (retrieval) with creating responses (generation) to provide better and more reliable answers.
