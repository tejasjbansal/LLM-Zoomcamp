## Open Source LLMs and Self hosting LLMs

Open-source large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence models for natural language processing (NLP) that are made available to the public with their source code and trained weights. These models allow developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to inspect, modify, and build upon them without restrictions. Open-source LLMs promote transparency, collaboration, and innovation within the AI community.

### Examples of Open-Source LLMs:
1. GPT-Neo and GPT-J by EleutherAI:
GPT-Neo: A series of models trained by EleutherAI as open-source alternatives to OpenAI's GPT-3. They offer models with varying sizes, including 1.3 billion and 2.7 billion parameters.
GPT-J: A 6-billion parameter model that provides performance comparable to GPT-3.
BERT by Google:

2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A model designed for understanding the context of words in search queries, which has become a foundation for many NLP tasks.
RoBERTa by Facebook AI:

3. RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach): An optimized version of BERT with improved training techniques and performance on various NLP benchmarks.
T5 by Google:

4. T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer): A model that frames all NLP tasks as a text-to-text problem, providing a versatile approach to various tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering.
OpenLLaMA by the Large Language Model Open-Source Community (LLaMO):

5. OpenLLaMA: An open-source implementation of LLaMA (Language Model for Multilingual Applications), providing multilingual capabilities and supporting various NLP applications.
DistilBERT by Hugging Face:

6. DistilBERT: A smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT that retains most of its performance while being more efficient.
GPT-2 by OpenAI:

7. GPT-2: Initially withheld due to concerns about misuse, it was later fully released and has become a popular choice for many NLP applications.
